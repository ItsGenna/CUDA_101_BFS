# CUDA_101_BFS
### Project for the **Passion in Action** GPU 101
The aim of this project is to implement a GPU-accelerated Breadth-First Search algorithm.
Unfortunately, the project is not completed yet, further optimizations are still incoming.
The updated code is in "main.cu", the original for comparison is in "bfgs.cpp". The GPU code is still far from being as fast
as the CPU version, as it can be seen from the table "BFS_time.xlsx".
